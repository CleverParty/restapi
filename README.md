solved red black tree implementation - 2

## Other Tree structures:
- 2-3-4 tree 
- Red Black tree


## In-Progress :

A **skip list** (structure) in two methods , representing a skip-list with two different implementations 
I've observed that a skip list looks similar to a balanced tree of similar height. so this can imply that a balanced tree can be simply flipped to represent a fast but more memory intense skip-list. 

- Method (A) :
 ->skip list represented with fastrand() generated levels for the skiplist.
 ->must behave as a doubly linked list in absense of "levels" functionality.

- Method (B) :
 ->Flip a fully balanced tree , as in the case of red-black tree balancing.
